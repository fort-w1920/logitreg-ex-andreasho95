\title{Negative Log-Likelihood for logistic regression}
\usage{
neg_loglik(coefs, design, response)

neg_loglik_deriv(coefs, design, response)
}
\arguments{
\item{coefs}{Numeric vector containing the coefficients for the logistic regression.}

\item{design}{Numeric matrix containing the (scaled) design matrix.}

\item{response}{Numeric vector containing the (scaled) response.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector containing the values of the distribution function for the given observations.
}
\description{
Calculates the value of the logistic distribution or its gradient given the coefficients, design
matrix and the response vector.
It is assumed that the data follow a distribution function that has location and scale values of 0.
}
\details{
Given the coefficients, the design matrix and the response vector, neg_loglik and neg_loglik_deriv
calculate the negative log-likelihood and its gradient, respectively.
